# JSON Module

This folder contains the JSON parsing utilities and example code used in the Embedded Journey project.

## Structure
- `inc/`: Header files for the JSON helper APIs.
- `src/`: Source files implementing JSON parsing/serialization logic.

## Usage
Include the headers from `inc/` in your application code and link the corresponding sources from `src/` in your build.

## Notes
The JSON module is intended for embedded environments and focuses on minimal dependencies and small footprint.
